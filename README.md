Lungs Cancer Detection

Welcome to our Lung Cancer Detection project! This README file will guide you through the process of setting up and utilizing our application for the early detection of lung cancer using supervised learning techniques.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving the survival rate of patients. Our project aims to assist in the early detection of lung cancer through the use of machine learning algorithms.

Features
Supervised Learning: We employ supervised learning techniques to train our model on labeled datasets for accurate lung cancer detection.
Web Application: Our application is built using Django framework, providing an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
Libraries: We utilize TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training deep learning models.
Installation
To set up the environment and run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd lung-cancer-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run migrations:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access the application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Usage
Upload Image: Users can upload chest X-ray images for analysis.
Analyze Image: Our model will process the uploaded image and provide the likelihood of lung cancer.
View Results: Results will be displayed indicating whether cancer is detected and the confidence level.
Dataset
Our model has been trained on a curated dataset of chest X-ray images with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of lung cancer. The dataset has been preprocessed for optimal model training.

Model Architecture
We have utilized a deep learning architecture implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for the detection of lung cancer. The model has been trained on the dataset to learn patterns indicative of lung cancer presence.

Future Enhancements
Integration of additional features for more comprehensive analysis.
Deployment on cloud platforms for wider accessibility.
Continuous improvement of the model through ongoing research and development.
